# Dicee

## My Goal

The objective of this tutorial is to introduce me to the core programming concepts that form the foundation of most of the apps I’ll build in the future. This app taught me important programming knowledge while building a neat dice app.

## What I Created

I created a Las Vegas dice app. I can make the die roll at the press of a button or by shaking my phone. With this app in my pocket, I’m fully set up to settle any score on the go!

## What I Learned

* How to create an app with behavior and functionality.
* How to create links between the Interface Builder files and code using IBActions and IBOutlets.
* How to get familiar with the Xcode code editor.
* How to use comments to annotate code.
* How to understand and use Swift constants and variables.
* How to understand and use collection types such as Swift arrays.
* How to test and debug my app with the Xcode console.
* How to learn about randomization and generate random numbers in Swift.
